      title: Multi-Implicit Chain of Thought Reasoning via Knowledge Distillation
      authors: Luke Rivard
      abstract: I referenced a paper that used Implicit chain of thought reasoning to speed up inference of gpt-2. I expanded upon it by allowing the model to perform simtaneous 2x2 inference using the same knowledge distillation process.

      title: ChatGPT vs Keyword Machine Learning
      authors: Luke Rivard
      abstract: I trained a NN and XGBoost model to predict amazon review scores based on the description. The results pointed out that ChatGPT really understands context, not just keywords by offering much better positive/negative review prediction. It was disapointing at predicting the exact score.

      title: Zoomerified Java Code Compiler
      authors: Luke Rivard
      abstract: This is just a stupid project I did for a course. I created a emulated compiler for Java that takes in "Zoomer" Java structured code and parses,compiles and runs its translated java program.
