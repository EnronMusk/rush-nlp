      title: ChatGPT vs Keyword Machine Learning
      authors: Luke Rivard
      abstract: I trained a NN and XGBoost model to predict amazon review scores based on the description. The results pointed out that ChatGPT really understands context, not just keywords by offering much better positive/negative review prediction. It was disapointing at predicting the exact score.

      title: Zoomerified Java Code Compiler
      authors: Luke Rivard
      abstract: This is just a silly project I did for a course. I created a Java program that emulates a compiler. The emulated compiler takes in "Zoomerfied" Java structured code and parses, compiles and runs its translated java program.
